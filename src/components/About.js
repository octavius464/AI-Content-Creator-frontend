            <p>Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, in particular machine learning, have brought
               into being numerous ground-breaking advances in different areas ranging from medicine to art.
               Its superhuman performance has blown our mind as to what machines are capable of achieving not only in inference 
               and decision-making but also in creativity and innovation in general. We hope that this masterpiece of science
               and engineering could benefit the public, in particular artists and graphics designers, by bringing them
               inspirations to their day-to-day work. Through this, we hope to enhance human cognitive capabilities with
               the help of machines.</p>
